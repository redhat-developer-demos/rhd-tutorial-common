https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift,window='_blank'] is a free Kubernetes cloud environment in a shared, multi-tenant OpenShift cluster that is pre-configured with a set of developer tools. The Developer Sandbox is active for 30 days and renewable once it expires.

Use your existing Red Hat account or create a new one, then follow the instructions on the screen. You should then be redirected to the Developer Sandbox page again, but this time, you should see a button labelled **Start using your sandbox**.
