https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[KinD] is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using container “nodes”.
kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

It's really easy to start using KinD with Podman Desktop.
Open Podman Desktop and click on bottom gear icon to open the `Settings` options.

Then select `Resources` option, and click on `Create New` button of `Kind` section.

IMPORTANT: In case you've not created yet, you need to create a Podman machine, clicking `Create New` button in `Podman` section.

Leave the default configuration values and create the cluster:

Aftera few moments, you'll have the cluster up and running. 
You can inspect running containers in Podman Desktop, to validate that KinD Pod is running:
